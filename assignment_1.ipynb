    "Implement a kernel density estimate (KDE) naive Bayes classifier and compare its performance to the Gaussian naive Bayes classifier. Recall that KDE has kernel bandwidth as a free parameter -- you can choose an arbitrary value for this, but a value in the range 5-25 is recommended. Discuss any differences you observe between the Gaussian and KDE naive Bayes classifiers. (As with the Gaussian naive Bayes, this KDE naive Bayes implementation should be your own and should not just call a pre-existing function.)"

Instead of using the (x,y) positions of keypoints, you might consider the angles of the limbs or body, or the distances between pairs of keypoints. How does a naive Bayes classifier based on your engineered features compare to the classifier using (x,y) values? Please note that we are interested in explainable features for pose recognition, so simply putting the (x,y) values in a neural network or similar to get an arbitrary embedding will not receive full credit for this question. You should be able to explain the rationale behind your proposed features. Also, don't forget the conditional independence assumption of naive Bayes when proposing new features -- a large set of highly-correlated features may not work well."
