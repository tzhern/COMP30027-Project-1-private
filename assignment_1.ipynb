    "Naive Bayes ignores missing values, but in pose recognition tasks the missing values can be informative. Missing values indicate that some part of the body was obscured and sometimes this is relevant to the pose (e.g., holding one hand behind the back). Are missing values useful for this task? Implement a method that incorporates information about missing values and demonstrate whether it changes the classification results."

    "Engineer your own pose features from the provided keypoints. Instead of using the (x,y) positions of keypoints, you might consider the angles of the limbs or body, or the distances between pairs of keypoints. How does a naive Bayes classifier based on your engineered features compare to the classifier using (x,y) values? Please note that we are interested in explainable features for pose recognition, so simply putting the (x,y) values in a neural network or similar to get an arbitrary embedding will not receive full credit for this question. You should be able to explain the rationale behind your proposed features. Also, don't forget the conditional independence assumption of naive Bayes when proposing new features -- a large set of highly-correlated features may not work well."
